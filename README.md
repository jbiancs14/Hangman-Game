# Hangman-Game
The Classic Hangman game in Java

Implementing the classic Hangman game in Java using tools like JUnit, the Scanner class, and the ArrayList data structure provides a comprehensive learning experience that enhances software engineering knowledge in multiple ways.

Firstly, using **JUnit for testing** reinforces the importance of writing test cases to verify code functionality. By testing individual methods, such as checking guessed letters or determining win/loss conditions, I gain insight into designing testable, modular code. It emphasizes the **test-driven development (TDD)** approach, where tests guide the implementation process and ensure the robustness of the application.

Secondly, leveraging the **Scanner class** to capture user input allows me to understand how to handle real-time input in Java applications. I learn to manage edge cases, such as invalid inputs, and build error-handling mechanisms, crucial skills in user-centric software design.

Incorporating the **ArrayList data structure** teaches me dynamic data management. Tracking guessed letters, for instance, highlights the flexibility and efficiency of ArrayLists compared to arrays. This understanding of data structures and algorithms is vital in creating scalable and optimized applications.

Finally, crafting the game logic refines my problem-solving and design skills, emphasizing concepts like **encapsulation, iteration, and conditionals**. Overall, this project bridges theoretical concepts with practical application, building a solid foundation for advanced software development.
